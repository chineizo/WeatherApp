# WeatherForecast App
The weather forecast application displays current weather conditions in New York and also
a 7-day weather forecast.

Model View View Model architecture was leveraged in creating the application.  

#Libraries
- `JetPack Componse`
- `Temperature`

The MainActivity shows:
- `Location`
- `Temperature`
- `Feels Like`
- `Humidity`
- `Wind speed/direction`
- `Atmospheric Pressure`

The Weather Details Activity shows:
- `Weather`
- `Temperature`
- `Feels Like`
- `Humidity`
- `Wind speed/direction`
- `Atmospheric Pressure`
- `Wind Speedt`
- `Wind Gust`
- `Dew Point`

#Future Work
Use Location API to return location information to feed into the weather api to show weather conditions anywhere.
Use graphic icons to represent weather conditions
For further optimization, add Dependency Injection library to provide the dependencies in the project
